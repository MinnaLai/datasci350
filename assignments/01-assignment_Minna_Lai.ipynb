In order to represent images in computers, we abstract the image into pixel (each dot in a grid of colors), which can be stored numerically corresponding to the color. This abstraction enables the predictive modelling to analyze the patterns in pixel values arrangement, so that the images can be classified or predicted based on the abstracted data of pictures rather than the complicated raw images in real life."
